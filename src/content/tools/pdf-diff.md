PDF Diff compares two PDF documents entirely on your device — no uploads, no servers, 100% client-side processing. It offers multiple views (side-by-side, unified, additions/removals/changes-only), exportable HTML/PDF reports, and a CLI you can run with `npx pdf-diff` for CI-friendly workflows. It’s delightful because it’s fast, works offline once loaded, and keeps sensitive documents private by design.
