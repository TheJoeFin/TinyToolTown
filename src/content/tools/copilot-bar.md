What started as a simple menu bar utility for grammar checks has evolved into a comprehensive application. With Copilot Bar, you can control your Mac, analyze documents, and automate screenshot uploads to S3/R2. It also streamlines your daily workflow by allowing you to set quick timers and take notes instantly without leaving your current task. Tailored to a developer's needs, it leverages the Copilot SDK and GPT-5-mini providing more than enough power for its design.
