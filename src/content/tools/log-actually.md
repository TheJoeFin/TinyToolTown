I'm trying to focus on my health more lately, but every food tracking app I tried drove me nuts — too many taps, too many screens, too much friction... so I built my own. The starting idea was simple: braindump what you ate in a stream-of-consciousness way (via text, voice, photo, or scan UPC), and wire it up to AI to turn word salad into structured data with nutritional information.

Once food tracking was working the way I liked, I added exercise logging because my watch doesn't do a great job of tracking weight-lifting workouts. And then after that, I added support for custom logs to log anything you want (body weight, blood pressure, sleep, mood, vibes, whatever)... a classic "if you give a mouse (PM) a cookie (MVP)..." situation.

It has a demo mode if you want to poke around without creating an account - try it out at [logactually.com](https://logactually.com/). Also see the changelog at https://logactually.com/changelog.
