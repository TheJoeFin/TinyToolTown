I made Windchime to scratch an itch I've had for a long time to easily tell how much data websites are loading as I browse. Turning the network traffic into audio tones means I can passively monitor the site for network traffic without having to take up screen real estate. Audio tones are assigned as follows: 

- Small files: High pitch, short duration
- Medium files: Medium pitch, medium duration
- Large files: Low pitch, long duration

I've been surprised and delighted to see which websites minimize network traffic and data and which ones abuse them!
