I use VS a lot for extension de elopement and end up with various versions, SKUs - and then their experimental instances! It was a chore to keep track of which ones were installed, where they were installed - then where’s the icon?

So here comes the tool - uses vswhere.exe behind the scenes to create the list and then there are some helper methods available for each one.
